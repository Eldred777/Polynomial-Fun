# polynomial-fun
 Doing some stuff with polynomials for fun. 
 
 The original idea was to do this in Haskell, and eventually work my way up to using it to numerically integrate things via interpolation. 

 Lots of directions to take it in, and really I'm just doing this for fun. I've got plans to do the same thing in a few languages, partially as practise in them, partially so if I ever need them I can just refer directly to them.
